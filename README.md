### Planned Features:
- **macOS Support**
- ~**Localized Translations**~
- **Key Re-mapper** - *This will allow you to map any key or key combination to whatever sound you like.*
- **GUI Improvements** - *I'm not a fan of having all the settings on one window, so I plan to rework the GUI.*
- ~**Activation on Specified Windows** - *This will be a setting that will allow the app to run only when a specified window/program is in focus.*~
- **Randomized Sound Option** - *This will "disguise" what you type by playing random sounds while typing.*
- **More Special Character Sounds**
